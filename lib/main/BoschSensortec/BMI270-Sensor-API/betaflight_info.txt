This library is used to support the Bosch BMI270 gyro sensor (see drivers/accgyro/accgyro_spi_bmi270.c).

The only file that is compiled as part of Betaflight is bmi270.c. This file contains the device microcode that must be uploaded during initialization. 

When upgrading this library the bmi270.h header must have the following code block added:

// Betaflight modifications begin
#define BMI270_CONFIG_SIZE 8192
extern const uint8_t bmi270_config_file[BMI270_CONFIG_SIZE];
// Betaflight modifications end
